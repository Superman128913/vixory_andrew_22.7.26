Why do I need to register?,Register for Vixory to be able to search for potential transfer college athletes based on the specific needs of your team. We make it easy and accessible for you to find a list of athletes who want to transfer to a school like yours.
How do I search for an athlete?,"Once you are registered, you can choose the criteria for the particular needs of your team. You can make a broad search or narrow it down as much as you choose. We recommend that your initial search be as broad as possible then narrow it down."
How do I contact an athlete?,"If you find an athlete who you are interested in talking to, request to connect with the athlete. The athlete must accept your request in order for you to communicate with them. If an athlete does not accept your request, please do not make multiple requests to that same athlete."
Will I be able to see athletes from my school on the site?,"No, the site is designed so that you may only see athletes from any other school that wants to transfer."
Is the confirmation that the athlete can transfer?,"We require the athlete to confirm that he or she is eligible to transfer and is in compliance with the requirements of their current affiliation, whether it is the NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, etc. We do not make any independent investigation of the athleteâ€™s compliance."
